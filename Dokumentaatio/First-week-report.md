# First week report

This week started with some rehearsing about the concepts I learned in course Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit. 
It's been 1,5 years since I had this course so I had to spent a moment or two with the old course materials.

I'm not sure if my topic is fitting but I think examining it will benefit me more than most of the topics that I could choose from.
This is mostly because I know a lot about this area thanks to the time I have spent with it: my Bachelor's thesis is based on this 
subject. And because I have already found the 'easy' solution (the really slow one, mind you), I don't need to waste my time on that 
thought anymore. 

So after doing some research I figured out that the solution could at least be O(n^2), probably better. When the program tries to find
the nearest match for the face it's recognising it doesn't need to go through the whole collection of the faces - the major part of the
faces can be ditched during the process without even looking at them.

I will begin with the basics this week after I get the confirmation for the topic. I'd like to have the possibility to use R in my program
because it could be helpful. But I think it's not absolutely necessary - it's possible that R is not fitted for this kind of problem at
all, though that's something that will become clear later during the coding.

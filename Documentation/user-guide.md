## User guide

Choose any file in .pgm format and in size of 92x112 and press Recognise.
- If you want to test the program with the AT&T faces, move a face file (.pgm) from the database to a different folder, remove ProjectedFaceMatrix.csv
and RandomMatrix.csv and rerun the program. Otherwise the program will recognise the same face which is not very interesting result.
All these will be in the same directory. (/FaceRecogniser/face-recogniser/src/main/resources/)
- There are multiple sites on internet you can use to convert .jpg files to .pgm. [Google search: convert jpg to pgm](https://www.google.fi/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=convert%20jpg%20to%20pgm)
